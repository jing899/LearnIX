## Introduction 

LearnIX is a tutorial website that aims to teach users how to use Unix through quizzes, and interactive activities. LearnIX starts with very simple concepts, teaching users how to navigate the Unix command line and then moves into increasingly more complex ideas for advanced users. A smooth layout allows users to go through tutorials at their own pace and includes a reference page for users to be able to quickly find a command they might need. The site is aimed toward Unix with the purpose of Web Development, and is perfect for anyone from novice to advanced. 
 
 
## Goals 
  - To teach users ranging from beginner to advanced how to use Unix, including the command line. 
  - With the use of interactivity and quizzes, reinforce knowledge that the users have read. 
  - Be a very simple and smooth website that covers the essential topics of Unix while keeping users engaged.
